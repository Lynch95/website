            <p><strong>Postponement of Peel Ski holiday to Saturday 14th January 2023</strong></p>"It is with great regret that I have to now announce the cancellation / postponement of the January 2022 Peel Ski Club holiday to Spital am Semmering, Austria. 
            This afternoon Alan Band has provided me with an update response we had sought from the two hotels about the current situation in Austria and Spital in particular. They have both agreed that it is better for us not to come, based mainly on rising COVID infection rates and a possible winter return to restrictions on hotels, bars and restaurants being open. Added to other factors impacting on travel plans, I now feel it would be foolhardy to carry on with the holiday. We as a club and individually would suffer financially if we had to cancel at a later time. 
            With the keen enthusiasm shown for this holiday, I am very motivated to postpone just one year, to Saturday 14th January 2023. 
            Sorry not to be meeting you all in January, but we will all meet again some sunny (or snowy) day."
