      <h1>About</h1>

          <p>The Peel ski club has its origins in the troubles in Northern Ireland.
            Police officers from the Metropolitan Police Service formed the club to take on holiday, officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary who had been injured in service.
            The first trip took place in 1998 to the ski resort in Spital am Semmering in Austria.
            Adaptive skiing took place allowing even the most severely injured officers to participate in this life enhancing sport.
            Each disabled skier has two or three buddies that ski with them throughout the week and care for them as needed.
            The trip was very successful and as a result has become a regular biennial event.
            The peace process in Northern Ireland has happily meant less officers were being injured in service and so the club has diversified, taking non-police personnel who were disabled perhaps because of injury or illness.
            The club has flourished with many new members.
            Very often lifelong friendships are made between the skier and the buddies, many of whom return again and again and often train up to be able to participate in the adaptive skiing themselves.
            In addition lifelong friendships have been made with the residents of the village of Spital am Semmering, who recently named the square in the village after the Peel ski club. 
            All disabilities are catered for but visually impaired skiing and sit skiing form the bulk of those being helped. The trips are very well organised with a base camp located for the week in Gerties Café at the base of the nursery slope. There are appropriately trained disabled ski instructors always present as well as medical staff and drivers of minibuses (including an adaptive one) for use around the resort and for transfers.
